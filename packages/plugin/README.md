# vite-plugin-inspect-config

A Vite plugin to write the [resolved config](https://vite.dev/guide/api-plugin#configresolved) to disk for easy inspection.

This plugin is intended to be used by plugin authors who wish to easily view config changes made by plugins for debugging purposes i.e. "did my plugin mutate the config how I intended it to"!
